<h2>Life of an Ant and a Spider</h2>
<hr />
<p>
    Behind the bush, upon the mound, <br />ants are moving without a sound.
    <br />Leaves are passed along the chain, <br />where ants are lined as one.
</p>

<p>
    Strands of silver make its net,<br />
    a fly is caught in its web;<br />
    Now itâ€™s too late,<br />
    the spider comes to seal its fate.
