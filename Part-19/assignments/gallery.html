            Welcome to our image gallery. Here you can find a collection of
            random images that demonstrate how to work with image embedding in
            HTML. Each image has been sourced from Lorem Picsum, offering a
            random selection of beautiful and interesting visuals that you can
            use to practice linking images in your web pages.

            The gallery is an example of how you can use the `<img />` tag in
            HTML to display images on your website. We’ve provided different
            image sizes and examples of both internal and external images, which
            is essential for building dynamic and visually engaging websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to explore the images, and don’t forget to try embedding
            your own images on your websites. Understanding how to use relative
            and absolute paths for images is a crucial skill when developing
            your web pages. Try experimenting with different images and layouts
            to enhance the look and feel of your website.
