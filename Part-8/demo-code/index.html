    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
    1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
    make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
    the leap into electronic typesetting,

    A broad range of industrial and consumer products use computers as control
    systems, including simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and
    remote controls, and factory devices like industrial robots. Computers are
    at the core of general-purpose devices such as personal computers and mobile
    devices such as smartphones. Computers power the Internet, which links
    billions of computers and users.

<h2>Etymology</h2>

<p>
    Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing
    element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a
    microprocessor, together with some type of computer memory, typically
    semiconductor memory chips. The processing element carries out arithmetic
    and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the
    order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices
    include input devices (keyboards, mice, joystick, etc.), output devices
    (monitor screens, printers, etc.), and input/output devices that perform
    both functions (e.g., the 2000s-era touchscreen). Peripheral devices allow
    information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the
    result of operations to be saved and retrieved.
