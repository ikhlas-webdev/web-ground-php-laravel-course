                This website is designed to teach the basics and advanced
                concepts of HTML. Starting with headings and paragraphs, we
                gradually move into more complex topics.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>HTML lists</b> are essential for organizing content. We have
                covered <i>ordered lists</i>, <i>unordered lists</i>, and
                <i>definition lists</i> to create well-structured information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding <mark>image paths</mark> is crucial. We have
                explored <small>relative paths</small> for local files and
                <small>absolute paths</small> for external resources. This
                knowledge is key for web development.

            <h2>Text Formatting</h2>
            <p>
                HTML provides various tags to format text, like
                <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em>, and
                <sup>superscript</sup>. Use these to make your content engaging.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also explored how to add <del>removed text</del> and
                <ins>inserted text</ins>, giving us flexibility in how we
                present information. Using the
                <span style="color: red">style attribute</span>, we can easily
                change text color and background color.
